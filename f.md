# f
f it is an simple programming language with a simple set of rules that makes it very powerfulI.  It is inspired in the human language and in the language of the science which is math. As both f is able to express multiple ideas and concepts and could help developers to make them feel free to write and create, less worry into learn the language they can have the ability to communicate their ideas, the other good part is that as the human languages and maths there are some freedom but also limitations just to prevent you to write something completely wrong.
The reality is that I'm creating this just for fun.

## Rules

1. You can define new functions using the equal token after the name.

```
helloworld = "Hello World!"
```

2. You can name your function.

Using spaces and lower case only:

```
hello world = "Hello World!"
```

Using the quote token and whatever text you want:

```
"üëãüåè" = "Hello World!"
```

3. You can communicate with the computer and other coders using many data types, the most popular are: Text, Number, Boolean, List.

```
œÄ = 3.14159...
"The ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything" = 42
c = 186,282 miles per second.
diseased = 0xD15EA5ED
coding is cool = true
list = 0, 4, 7
```

5. You can indicate inputs to your functions.

Adding the input name at the end or at the beginning of the function name:

```
square of x = x * x
x al cuadrado = x * x
```

Using the data type name:

```
add Number to Text = text + number
```

Using the less than an greater than tokens:

```
circunference of a <radius>circle = 2 * œÄ * radius
```

Using the slash token: (I'm not sure how useful is this)

```
using a Number you can get / next = number + 1
you can get the / next / number of a Number = number + 1
```


6. You can define new data types using the arrow token.

```
Student ->
    name,
    grade
```

7. You can access functions inside your new type with the underscore token.

```
you can / promote / the Student = student _ grade = + 1
```

8. You can use parenthesis token to explicitly group operation sequences.

9. You cannot use nothing functions from the exterior. just one level?

10. You can infer the inputs you need only when you are inside a lambda.

11. If you have all the inputs you need in the lambda, you are ready to go.

12. The lambda token is ":" and the definition of params that the lambda receive.

13. There are pre defined functions to help you communicate your ideas.

14. The name of a function can be repeated, in order to perform additional steps (similar to recursion? or chaining?)
